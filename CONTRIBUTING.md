## Commit Message Guidelines

All commit messages **must follow this format**:

```sh
<type>(<scope>): <subject> :<emoji>:
```

**Allowed types:**  
`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`

**Scope:**  
The feature, module, or section affected (use lowercase, numbers, or hyphens).

**Subject:**  
Short summary of the change (start with a lowercase letter, no period at the end).

**Emoji:**  
A [GitHub emoji code](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) describing the change, required at the end.

**Examples:**
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 support :sparkles:`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment bug :bug:`
- `docs(readme): improve usage instructions :memo:`
- `revert(auth): restore legacy login method :rewind:`

## Pull Request Rules

- **Do not remove or rename the following files:**  
  - `README.md`
  - `LICENSE`
  - `.gitignore`
- **Every PR must pass all Commit Base Checks** (commit message lint, and required files must exist).
- If you break the format, CI will fail and your PR will not be merged until fixed.
